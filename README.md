# 👋 Hello, I'm IroncladDev

I'm IroncladDev, a seventeen-year-old Fullstack Web Developer who lives out in the country. 

I enjoy developing websites, creating content, building with AI, competitive programming, and Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu.

I code because it allows me to express my imagination and creativity. What other programmers develop inspires me to build and inspire others.
