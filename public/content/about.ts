    title: "My coding Journey üß≠",
    paragraphs: [
      "My passion for programming started at the age of eleven in late 2016. My mom's midwife, who delivered my little brother, introduced me to [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org).",
      "After having completed most of the programming courses on Khan, I moved on to [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) and gained a decent understanding in Frontend Development.",
      "I moved on to learn how to make fullstack websites with Flask (python) on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com), discovered Replit, and started interacting with other communities.",
      "Discord enabled me to communicate in realtime with other programmers, massively improving my productivity.  After joining the platform, I did some really foolish stuff, got my account nuked, and hung around people I really shouldn't have.",
      "Shortly after, I started competitive programming for the next few months.",
      "In November 2021, Replit announced their Kajam competition, which I was super hyped up about.  Participating in the competition really got me close to the community, and that's when I finally cut the rope on Khan and moved over to Replit.",
      "Shortly after Kajam, I decided that I wanted to work at Replit, so I applied for an internship.  I flunked the interview but wasn't about to stop there.",
      "For the next few months, I drilled and raced solving programming algorithms as fast as I could, got really close to the Replit community, and became site moderator on Replit.  I also learned Next.js and switched my html/css/js/node/mongo stack to Next.js",
      "I created a lot more content with Next.js, started building moderation tools, and changed the way moderation worked at Replit.  I did some contract work for Replit's moderation team for a bit.",
      "Finally, I decided to try to apply to work at Replit again.  I had racked up a large amount of knowledge in the past year and was ready to try again.",
      "I wrote an [email](https://email.ironcladdev.repl.co) to Amjad Masad, the CEO of Replit and sent the HTML email to him with Node.js.  I almost got in, but the engineering team didn't have the time or capacity to mentor me.  The head of Support posted in discord that he needed a support engineer, and I decided to go for it.  After going through all the interviews, I got hired.",
      "For the next year, I fixed some issues I had been wanting to fix for years, remodeled some of Replit's Support tools, hammered hard on abusers, remodeled and maintained the docs, built some fun projects with AI, maintained the [Replit Extensions Client](https://github.com/replit/extensions) and helped out with DevRel.",
