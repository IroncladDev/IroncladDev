      `### Discovery üîé
      \nMy passion for programming started at the age of eleven after having been introduced to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org).`,
      `### Learning üß≠
      \nFor the next three years, I would learn frontend development from Khan and [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org), and the basics of Fullstack Web Applications from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).`,
      `### Connection üåê
      \nI searched for a suitable place to host my fullstack websites.  I found [Replit](https://replit.com) and joined their [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/friendsofreplit).  I also joined an unofficial Khan Academy discord server.\n\nDiscord allowed me to communicate with others in realtime, dramatically improving my productivity.  I hung around people I shouldn't have, did some foolish stuff, and got my account nuked.`,
      `### Competition üèÜ
      \nI started to dip into competitive programming by doing a few coding challenges and hackathons.  In November of 2021, Replit announced their annual game jam.  Participating in it helped me get close to the community.  I cut the rope on Khan and stuck to Replit.`,
      `### Motivation üî•
      \nAfter participating in the game jam, I decided that I wanted to work at Replit.  I applied for an internship and flunked the interview.  I wasn't about to stop there.
      \nIn the next eight months, I did a three-month internship at [Saasbox](https://saasbox.net), raced solving algorithms on [Codingame](https://codingame.com), learned and build multiple projects with Next.js, and took up the responsibility of moderating the Replit community.
      \nI made some impactful improvements to Replit's moderation tools and did some contract work for their Trust and Safety team.  I decided it was time to apply for Replit again.`,
      `### Opportunity ‚ú®
      \nAfter two more attempts, I got hired by Replit as a Support Engineer.  For the next year, I
      - Built more powerful anti-abuse tools
      - Fixed bugs and added features I'd been requesting
      - Improved some of Replit's Support Tools
      - Remodeled and maintained the docs
      - Built some AI projects
      - Maintained the [Replit Extensions Client](https://github.com/replit/extensions)
      - Helped out with DevRel & Marketing on twitter`,
      `### Next steps
      \nIn the next step of my life, I want to dive deeper into Content Creation and Entrepreneurship.`,

      "**Q: What's your favorite programming language?**\n\n**A**: Typescript.  It's like Javascript but more scalable and with a much better Developer Experience.",
      "**Q: What's your worst favorite programming language?**\n\n**A**: Java.  Super heavy Object-oriented programming and mandatory semicolons are pure pain.",
      "**Q: Are you available for hire?**\n\n**A**: Yes!",
      "**Q: Are you open to collaboration?**\n\n**A**: I have multiple ongoing projects at the moment, but I'd be happy to try out and provide feedback on your project.",
      "**Q: What's the best way to reach you?**\n\n**A**: Join my [Discord Server](/discord) and ping me, or reach out to me with a Twitter Direct Message.",
