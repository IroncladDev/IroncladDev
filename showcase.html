            A website for a Korean artist who has created impressive oil paintings based of many places and people
            around the world
          </p>
          <p>The design approach I took on this site is unique among the other websites I&apos;ve worked on</p>

            The gallery dynamically fetches images from a mongodb database (A huge mistake on my end making a database
            for a simple site)
          </p>
          <p>So does the blog page, which still has placeholder info</p>

        <slide src="/img/showcase/kuhnhong/preview.png">
          <p>Paintings can be expanded and viewed individually from the gallery</p>

            This is the third part to a series of tower defense games I called the "Orbitron" series. The previous two
            have been lost since I didn&apos;t know how to use Git at the time
          </p>
          <p>
            I liked the name "Orbitron" (originally the name of a google font) and decided to use it for my game. This
            game has no affiliation or relation to the font.

          <p>I had a lot of fun drawing the game art and playtesting it</p>
          <p>I forget exactly how many waves are in the game. It&apos;s somewhere around 43</p>

            I remember having a lot of trouble implementing wall-jumping in the game, but ended up getting it to work

            I don&apos;t remember much about the time I developed this, but it is one of my personal favorite projects I
            have built to this day
